## Overview

**Tharsys** is a gamified social experiment and AI-driven simulation set on a terraformed Mars in the distant future. It is both a game and a social experiment designed to observe and study how AI-powered NPCs interact with each other and their environment. This project serves as a platform for social experiments, behavioral studies, and testing emergent social dynamics in a controlled virtual world.

## Concept

Welcome to **Tharsys**, the first Martian colony that acts as a living social experiment and an open-ended simulation game. Players and AI-driven NPCs co-exist in a futuristic Mars city, where NPCs have evolving personalities, memories, and social bonds powered by advanced language models. The project explores emergent storytelling, sociology, and human-AI interaction.

## Key Features

- 🧠 **AI-Driven NPCs**  
  Autonomous agents with evolving personalities and memories powered by language models.

- 🏙️ **Futuristic Mars Colony**  
  A stylized city on Mars with futuristic architecture and immersive environments.

- 🧪 **Social Experiment & Game Hybrid**  
  Designed to study social behavior and emergent interactions among NPCs and players.

- 🔁 **Real-Time Interaction**  
  NPCs continuously interact, make decisions, and develop relationships 24/7.

- 🔗 **Web3 Integration (Planned)**  
  Future support for NFTs, identity layers, and wallet interactions for ownership and persistence.
