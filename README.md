# Tharsys

**Tharsys** is a social simulation and AI-driven town set on a terraformed Mars in the distant future. Inspired by the colonization spirit of the old frontiers—but without Western symbolism—it explores the birth of a new civilization through interactive NPCs powered by AI.

## 🌍 Concept

Welcome to **Nova Tharsys**, the first Martian colony to thrive as both an experiment in social behavior and an open-ended simulation game. New settlers arrive from Earth, building futuristic homes, vehicles, and systems, and writing the new history of humanity—one conversation at a time.

## 🎯 Key Features

- 🧠 **AI-Driven NPCs**  
  Fully autonomous agents with evolving personalities and memories powered by language models.

- 🏙️ **Futuristic Mars City**  
  A city built on Mars using clean, stylized visuals and futuristic architecture.

- 🧪 **Social Experiment Meets Game**  
  A hybrid experience that explores sociology, emergent storytelling, and player observation.

- 🔁 **Real-Time Interaction**  
  NPCs talk, make decisions, and develop social bonds 24/7, even when you're not around.

- 🔗 **Web3-Ready Architecture** *(coming soon)*  
  Planned integration with NFTs, identity layers, and wallet interaction for ownership and persistence.
